# Zoo
### What is on this program
This task consisted of us creating an OOP example, by utilising Classes and Modules we have practised in class earlier.
The topic I chose was a Zoo, so this program shows what animals there are in the Zoo, the price of the tickets and a little description about the animal. Such as if it have 2 or 4 legs and a small statement about the animal.
